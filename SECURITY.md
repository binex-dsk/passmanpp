## Reporting a Vulnerability
### ALWAYS CHECK THE LATEST COMMITS, ISSUES, AND PULL REQUESTS TO SEE IF IT'S ALREADY BEEN REPORTED/FIXED!

Please report all security vulnerabilities through the issues tab. If you know how to fix them, make a PR.

To ensure proper handling of this, provide the following:
- What the vulnerability is
- How it can be exploited
- What it affects
- Where you believe the vulnerability to be (I/A)

Expect responses within a day or two. I'm usually able to respond from 6 AM to 10 PM, both EST. If your vulnerability is declined for any reason I will tell you why.
