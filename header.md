# .pdpp format
The  `.pdpp` format used by passman++. These docs are useful for knowing the inner workings of passman++, or simply for integrating `.pdpp` support into your application.

# Header
The header contains the magic number, version number, all information needed to work with the database, and the name and description.
- 4 bytes: PD++ (magic number)
- 1 byte: version number
- 1 byte: checksum choice:
  * 0 = Blake2b
  * 1 = SHA-3
  * 2 = SHAKE-256
  * 3 = SKEIN-512
  * 4 = SHA-512
  * The output length, in bytes, for all except SHA-512, is the maximum key length for the encryption option chosen.
- 1 byte: hash choice:
  * 0 = Argon2id + derivation
  * 1 = Bcrypt + derivation
  * 2 = Scrypt + derivation
  * 3 = no hash, only derivation
  * Output length is 512 bytes.
- 1 byte: number of hashing iterations
- 1 byte: keyfile required (0 or 1 for off/on)
- 1 byte: type of encryption
  * 0 = AES-256/GCM
  * 1 = TwoFish/GCM
  * 2 = SHACAL2/EAX
  * 3 = Serpent/GCM
- 2 bytes (uint16_t): Argon2id memory usage (in MB)
- 1 byte: "clear seconds" (delay before the clipboard is cleared when a password is copied)
- 1 byte: compression on/off
- database IV
  * length of IV is the default nonce length of the encryption option chosen
- database name (terminated by a newline)
- database description ("")

# Data
The rest of the data is the encrypted SQLite data.
- Every entry has one table
  * Basic attributes: name, email, url, password (all `text`), and notes (`blob`)
  * Notes' newlines are stored as " || char(10) || "
  * User-input attributes must never have any conflicting names at all, and are any of: string, number, bool, and multi-line text
    - Store strings as `text`, numbers as `real`, bools as `integer` (0 for off, anything else for on), and multi-line text as `blob`
  * Each input attribute is stored as its own column
  * (FUTURE) Store an icon name as text, which refers to the system theme's icon of that name
- Encrypt the table's CREATE TABLE and INSERT statements with the chosen encryption function. Key is the password hashed with the chosen hash (salted with the IV), then derived using PBKDF2 (output length is 32 bytes), where its HMAC is the chosen checksum method. IV is the database's IV.
- **BEFORE** encryption, compress with gzip

# Extra development help
- See the `sql.cpp`, `database.cpp`, and `entry.cpp` files for help with creating an implementation. In fact, feel free to straight-up use this backend - without any modifications. However, you'll probably want to do some - this is intended simply as a standard application, and GUIs must be accomodated to your type of application. Especially in later revisions, as the GUI will be drastically improved, and the CLI gone. Plus, you'll need to implement cross-format integration in most cases, which this isn't designed for.

- Nothing actually needs to be the same, though - feel free to use any SQLite backend you choose. However, you'll almost certainly need to use Botan - passman++ relies on many of its features that simply aren't available on others like Crypto++. Don't worry that Botan is just a C++ library though - it's got some C bindings. Check in the [handbook](https://botan.randombit.net/handbook/api_ref/) for more details.

- I also recommend using Qt for your SQLite backend, as it provides a good interfacing for the database and provides proper classes.

- NEVER use ANY beta standards (such as this one). These are HIGHLY UNSTABLE and subject to breaking changes. Always, always, ALWAYS create your implementation using the latest release's standard format.

- ALL attributes for entries MUST be editable.

- The SQLite is flexible to your will - you can freely create new connections and store configuration there, for example. However, always keep separate tables for entries. NEVER create just a single table for entry data, as this will break compatibility!

- Finally, once again, look at my implementations first. It will give you a good guide on how to read and interact with the data, generate databases, create SQL statement sequences, and much, much more. Like I said, you can even use that as your backend if you please.
